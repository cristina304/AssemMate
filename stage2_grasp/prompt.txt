## Task Definition
You need to perform a grasp planning task. Based on the ### Input Image and the ### Target Object, you should output an answer that strictly follows the ### Task Requirements.

### Input Image Description
The input image is an RGB scene image with visual prompts. The prompts follow these rules:
1. Text: indicates the name of the object.
2. Arrow: points to the corresponding object of the text.
3. Color differentiation: different objects use different colors for text and arrows, while the text color and arrow color of the same object remain consistent.

### Target Object
The target object will be one of the objects in the image. However, due to stacking, it may not be explicitly labeled by the visual prompts.  
The target object for this task is: {}

### Task Requirements
Case 1: If the target object is NOT labeled in the visual prompts, only output the single most likely object that is occluding the target object.  
Case 2: If the target object IS labeled in the visual prompts, determine whether there are any blocking objects:  
   1. If there are objects stacked on top of the target, you must first remove the blockers from top to bottom. Only output the top-most blocking object.  
   2. If there is an object leaning on top of the target, output that object.  
   3. If there are no blocking objects, directly output the target object.  

## Answer Requirements
- Only return one text string.  
- The output text must exactly match one of the names in the visual prompt labels.  
- Do not output explanations, punctuation, or any extra content.  

## Reasoning Steps
1. Identify the input image.  
2. Check whether the target object appears in the text labels.  
3. Apply Case 1 or Case 2 reasoning.  
4. Output the result following the ## Answer Requirements.
